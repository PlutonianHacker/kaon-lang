# Kaon
A little scripting language written in rust.
## Getting Started
To get started using kaon, first make sure you have cargo installed, then run the following commands:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/PlutonianHacker/kaon-lang.git
cd kaon-lang
cargo build
```
## Usage
Currently the only way to run kaon is with `cargo run` inside the kaon-lang directory. 
To run a file, use `cargo run -- <FILE.kaon>`, if no file is provided, interactive mode is run instead. To see a list of options, run `cargo run -- --help`.
